# Version 1.3.2

* Fixed a bug where moving items from InfChest to StorageBox didn't work.
  * Right click with Storage Box (contains the same items with InfChest) to move items to Storage Box.
  * Click with empty Storage Box will cause nothing to prevent bugs, fill it before touching.

# Version 1.3.1

* Added Deque.
* Improved waila tooltip.
* Support of combining chests.
  * Put InfChest to the left slot. Then items are moved.
  * You can move items
    in [Storage Box](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/break-all-of-the-same-block-and-more/files/2740442),
    too.

# Version 1.3

* Show display name of stack on the tooltip.
* Added support for TOP, just showing stack's display name and item count.
* Un-stackable items are now not stacked. (When you picked up items in the right slot on InfChest GUI, portions were stacked.)

# Version 1.2
---
* Fixed item count overflow in AE2 Terminal.
* Removed nbt tag ("ForgeCaps", "ForgeData") when item is dropped.
